      "Construction for the Ebony Guest House began in the 1940s by Reverend Norman Holmes, husband to Mary Holmes, who lived in the property adjacent to the Guest House. They originally intended for the house to be a bread-and-breakfast-style hotel for Black traveling ministers. The Holmes posted an ad in The Negro Motorist Green Book, a travel guide from 1936 to 1966 for African Americans, which provided safe places – such as hotels and restaurants – for traveling throughout the segregated south.",
      "The house opened its doors officially in May 1949 and remained open for over 20 years. ",
      "The building got its name from Catherine Harris, who suggested the Black association would be clear to visitors without having to use signs outside the residence. During these years of operation, the children and grandchildren of the family took care of the laundry, delivered meals to guests, and tended the garden.",
      "The Ebony Guest House was also close to the American League Stadium, now Dr. Iola Jones Park, which is also featured on this tour. Due to this proximity, the guest house often hosted musical artists who performed at the Stadium. Some notable guests included Jackie Wilson, Ray Charles, Fats Domino, The Marvelettes, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.",
      "Tharpe was known as the grandmother of rock 'n' roll and traveled with artists including the Jordanaires, an all-white group, and the Lucky Millinder Orchestra. Due to rampant segregation at the time, Thorpe would often sleep on the tour bus and pick up food from the back of restaurants. Places like the Ebony Guest House provided Thorpe with somewhere hospitable to stay while she traveled, rather than staying on the bus all the time. ",
      "However, during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, many places previously unavailable to the Black community were now open to them, which meant that several Black businesses, such as the guest house, began to close down. In 1972, the guest house halted its operations, due largely to Mrs. Holmes' failing health and rival competition. Mrs. Holmes passed away in 1981, and her grandchildren, Priscilla and Gloria Holmes, decided to take up the mantle and reopen the guest house. The guest house was renamed Holmes Apartments, which still are in use today and owned by the Holmes family, passed down through generations."

In 1923, Davis helped to pass legislation that allowed funding for the public library. The Florence County Library opened in November 1925.",
      "Frank V. Hopkins and William Wilkins handled the architectural design. Wilkins was also responsible for creating the Poynor school, which you can learn more about on this tour.",
      "The building has two stories, as well as a raised basement, and is built in Neo-Classical Revival style. This style features columns, pediments, and round arches with exteriors that are symmetrical.",
      "The last names of prominent American writers are also featured above the windows. If you look up, you should be able to see those names. There are names of world-renowned authors such as James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Edgar Allan Poe, as well as South Carolina authors like Paul Hamilton Hayne. There is also a window for Henry Timrod, a teacher in Florence, who would later have a schoolhouse and park named after him. These places are also featured in this tour.",
      "In July 1964, the Florence Public Library merged with the Florence County Circulating Library to create the Florence County Library system. This merger happened thanks to the efforts of the County Superintendent of Education, the Florence Public Library Board, and the South Carolina State Library. The library expanded, opening branches in the surrounding areas including Pamplico, Johnsonville, Lake City, Olanta, and Timmonsville.",
      "In 1977, prominent architect J. Russell Bailey was hired to recommend renovations for the building. Bailey was a proponent of modular design, and he consulted on many university libraries throughout the United States, including those at Yale University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Maryland. Bailey’s recommendations for the Florence County Library included outer expansions to wrap around three sides of the building. Local architect James Paul Barnes integrated Bailey’s recommendations into his design for the renovations.",
      "Visitors are not able to go inside this location, as it is now an office for the Florence School District 1. However, visitors are encouraged to park and walk around the exterior of the building to see the architectural elements."

      "In 2009, architects Watson Tate Savory and Cooper Robertson Partners were hired to design the building. After five years of construction, the Museum opened its doors on October 12, 2014.",
      "Some of the collections housed in the museum include reptile remains from the Cretaceous Period, period artifacts dating back to the Native American and Colonial periods, Civil War artifacts found from the Florence Stockade (which is also featured on this tour), and fragments of the MK-6 atomic bomb accidentally dropped on Mars Bluff in 1958.",
      "Another notable exhibit is a collection of works by William Johnson, a famous Black painter from Florence who is also discussed on this tour. Johnson’s work includes oil paintings such as Evening, which is oil painted on burlap, and Cagnes-sur-Mer, an oil painting on canvas. More of Johnson's work can also be found in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.",
      "Next is the Wright Collection of Southern Art, formed by Ann and Louis Wright and later acquired by the Drs. Bruce and Lee Foundation. This collection includes roughly 140 works from the 20th Century. Some people included in the exhibit are Sherer Wright Royce, the daughter of Ann and Louis Wright, who is an associate professor at Coastal Carolina University. There are also pieces from Martha Severens, who used to be a curator at the Gibbs Museum of Art from 1976 until 1987. She moved to work at the Greenville County Museum for Art from 1992 until 2010, before retiring. Benjamen Zeigler, a local attorney whose family has a longstanding history in the Florence area, also has items in the collection.",

      "On March 5, 1865, 546 soldiers, under the command of Union Colonel Reuben Williams, fought Confederate army soldiers at this location. The soldiers were part of the 12th Indiana Infantry, a detachment from William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union Army.",
      "The Union soldiers outnumbered the Confederates 2 to 1, marching into Florence to destroy the railroad and its accompanying station. Doing so would allow them to cut off supplies to the Confederate army. The region had historically been known for its railroads as a primary source of transportation for plantation crops like cotton. People like Henry Johnson, the father of William Johnson who is featured on this tour, built the railways.",
      "Sherman’s bowties” were used to destroy the tracks. The tracks were heated and then bent into pretzel shapes. This method got its name from General Sherman, who was known for destroying railroads as a way to overpower his Confederate enemies.",
      "Sherman’s army used a three-pronged assault to defeat the Confederates in this area. The first skirmish took place here at Gamble’s Hotel, where the North Eastern and Wilmington & Manchester Railroads converged. The second one was at Church and Palmetto Streets where the North Eastern Railroad had maintenance shops, and the final one was somewhere between the two locations.",
      "Initially, it looked as though the Union forces would be successful. One informant told a reporter from The Charleston Daily Courier that he encountered Confederate deserters trying to get home. One of the deserters told him 'the jig was up' and 'it was no use fighting any longer.'",
      "However, 400 reinforcements came to aid the local Confederates in fighting the Union soldiers, forcing Sherman’s troops to retreat to Darlington before they could dismantle the railways. However, they did destroy some crops before the retreat. According to The Intelligencer out of Anderson, South Carolina, 'All the cotton, both Government and private, about three thousand bales, at Florence was burned.' This was one of the two defeats Sherman had in South Carolina; the other took place in Aiken.",
      "Mrs. C. D. Bristow, who was still a child in 1865, recalled hearing the gunshots and seeing the soldiers glisten in the sunlight.",
      "Thankfully for the residents of the small village of Florence, while military supplies often passed through the railways, this was the only Civil War action that took place here.",
      "Visitors are welcome to park in the open lot at Coit and Baroody, the former location of Gamble’s Hotel, and walk over to view the historical marker."

      "The schoolhouse is named after Henry Timrod, who is often called the 'Poet Laureate of the Confederacy,' although it was an unofficial title. He was born in 1828 and attended the University of Georgia in the 1840s. As a lover of the Romantic period, he began publishing poems in South Carolina newspapers and periodicals.",
      "With the help of Paul Hamilton Hayne, Timrod founded Russell’s Magazine in 1857. The magazine was named after John Russell’s Charleston bookstore. It ran for 3 years and aimed to keep politics out of its literary assessments. Timrod himself published 37 poems throughout the years in the magazine.",
      "Starting in 1858, Timrod taught the children of Colonel William Henry Cannon, Jr., at Orange Grove Plantation in Mars Bluff, as well as white children from other nearby plantations. He got the job when he visited his sister and brother-in-law, George Muno Goodwin, who was an overseer on Orange Grove Plantation. This one-room schoolhouse where Timrod taught was built in 1859, the same year he published his first book of poetry, simply titled Poems.",
      "When the American Civil War began, Timrod left Mars Bluff and headed to Charleston. There, he initially opposed the decision to secede from the United States. However, he joined the Confederate Army until his medical discharge due to tuberculosis. He still campaigned for the Confederacy, giving a lecture in 1863 before the Methodist Female College in Columbia, encouraging them to aid Confederate soldiers. The next year, he moved to Columbia and married his former student, Kate Goodwin, who gave birth to their son Willie.",
      "In February of 1865, Union troops ransacked and burned Columbia. At this point, Timrod was living in poverty and taking loans from friends. In October of the same year, his son Willie passed away. After nearly a year of grieving, Timrod became a partial owner of the South Carolinian, a daily newspaper published in Columbia.",
      "In 1867, Timrod lost his battle with tuberculosis and passed away. He is buried at the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral Cemetery in Columbia. However, his name continues to be present. In 1930, the plantation and accompanying schoolhouse where he had worked were donated to the Ellison Capers Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The schoolhouse was moved to the grounds of the Poynor Junior High School, also featured on this tour. It was moved yet again in 1938 to the park now named after Timrod.",
      "The park has a monument to Timrod with a front, side, and back phrase that you can read while visiting. Together they read, 'The poet to the whole wide world belongs. So in thy thoughts, though clothed in sweet repose, they life shall bear its flowers in future times. All human thoughts and human passion wait upon the genuine bard.'",
      "The schoolhouse was donated to the Florence County Museum in 2012, where deliberation was held about whether it should be moved again or remain in the park. The Timrod Park Neighborhood Association fought against it being moved. They voted that it would stay in the park, and the county agreed to provide maintenance and upkeep.",
      "The park surrounding the school has 11 lighted tennis courts, 10 pickleball courts, a playground, picnic areas, a picnic shelter, a gazebo, a fitness area, an amphitheater, and handicap-accessible nature trails.",
      "Long after his passing, Henry Timrod’s legacy in the Florence area continues in the structures named after him, including the schoolhouse and the accompanying park."

Through her work, she became a consultant for the White House in 1950. In that role, she helped develop a foster care system for the Florence area. Dr. Jones wanted to ensure that the children of the community were being properly cared for.",
      "Before the park was built, the location used to be the American Legion Stadium. Built in the 1930s, the segregated stadium eventually burned down in 1970. The cause of the fire remains unknown. However, after the area was cleared, Dr. Iola Jones Park was built, although we are unsure of what year exactly it was finished. The park was named in Jones’s honor after she passed, standing as a thank-you for all the work she contributed to the community.",
      "Today, the park has a variety of activities for the community to take part in within its seven-point-five acres. The newest addition to the park is its indoor community center, added in 2020. The building has a variety of activities, including a boxing ring, foosball, and other rooms where community members can relax. The outdoor section of the park includes activities such as four joined basketball courts, a baseball field, a softball field, and a playground for children. The park also features a quarter-of-a-mile walking trail where visitors can enjoy the scenery.",

      "The sit-in movement sought to end segregation at white-owned establishments. The Kress Demonstration took place over two days. Members of the local youth branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) protested the segregated lunch counter at the S.H. Kress department store. Most of these students attended Wilson High School.",
      "John Wesley Miller, Jr. was Vice President of the NAACP youth branch and organized the demonstration at Kress on the third and fourth of March 1960. On the first day of the protest, over thirty students met at Trinity Baptist Church to prepare for a march to the department store and a sit-in at the lunch counter. Before the demonstration, they sent a protester named Cecil Gunter because they believed that his lighter skin would get him served by the workers. To their dismay, he was denied service.",
      "Not only did they deny him service, but they kicked Gunter out of the establishment. Twenty-five more students still partook in this demonstration. They entered through the Dargan Street door where they were met with workers saying, “Clear the counter. We’re not serving you.” The students stayed at the lunch counter even though the workers denied them service and asked them to leave. In order for the students to leave, the manager called the police and turned off the lights of the establishment.",
      "The students were told to leave by the Chief of Police, Melvin D. Adams, and City Manager, Aaron March. The students returned to the store to see a closed building with trash cans replacing their seats.",
      "On March 4, more students joined the protest, making it over seventy participants. The young students created signs that they pinned to their shirts saying, “Our money is the same,” “Give us equality,” and “Full service or none.” They split into two groups before they had to reroute because of a barricaded Kress store. The police snatched the students’ signs from their clothing, often damaging their shirts and dresses.",
      "They were met with name-calling by bystanders and were taken to the Florence jail in pairs through the backdoor of the Kress store. They were peaceful, but policemen charged forty-eight students with “parading without a permit.” The police body searched the students, took their pictures, and questioned them after arriving at the jailhouse. After being held in the jailhouse for many hours, the police released the students around 1:00 a.m. on March 5 on a $100 total bond.",
      "The Florence Recorder’s Court first heard their case on April 20th. William Bennett and Matthew Perry were not a part of the NAACP, but they were attorneys who represented the students. Judge Charles C. McDonald convicted thirty-four students of “parading without permits,” and they were sentenced to a thirty-dollar fine.",
      "Their attorneys appealed the case, and the South Carolina Supreme Court determined the convictions of the students were wrongful, overturning McDonald’s earlier ruling. Though the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the students’ convictions, the charges were not immediately dropped. There were still individuals charged in 1960 who had those charges on their records until late 2014 and 2020.",

      "Today, this building houses the Poynor School, but it was once the original location of the Wilson School. The Wilson School was built in 1866 as a segregated school for African American children residing in the Florence County area. The first records of the school date back to November of 1869, when it still bore the Wilson name and was located at the corner of Dargan and Palmetto Street. The school was likely named for the Methodist Minister, Reverend Joshua Wilson, who was an early principal of the school. As the years went by, Wilson became known as one of the most outstanding schools in the entire state. However, the building was torn down in 1906. A new school was built on Athens Street in 1917, where prominent African Americans were in attendance, such as William H. Johnson, who you will learn about more on this tour. The school moved a final time in 1982, where Wilson High School still exists today on Old Marion Highway.",
      "In the place of the original Wilson School, local architect William Wilkins erected Poynor Junior High School at this same spot on Dargan and Palmetto Street in 1908. Poynor is the oldest school building still standing in Florence County and is the building that you see before you. Poynor is two stories high and built in a Neoclassical Georgian Revival style, which means that the building features lots of symmetry and classical detailing. When looking at the building head-on, you’ll notice the uniformity of the windows, columns, and other features. The school was even used as the location of a banquet held for President William Howard Taft in 1910.",
      "In May of 1983, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places and remains an important piece of Florence’s history to this day. Nowadays the building houses an adult education center and has been used to host recitals, concerts, tournaments, fundraisers, and other events. This location’s historical ties to education are undeniable. Further, it reminds us how the African American community of Florence persevered in their efforts to provide learning opportunities for their children."

Sixteen large trench graves became the National Cemetery. The smaller trench graves carried the remains of 2,322 men, and these were moved to the National Cemetery.",

When a doctor examined her, he discovered her gender. She was placed with the women of Florence, where they gave her extra rations to help her recovery.

The second pedestrian gate is located on the east side and has a brick fence around it. This portion of the cemetery is the oldest and was donated by Dr. Jarrott in 1865. Two more acres were added to the cemetery in 1943, and it was expanded by one more acre in 1984. In 1998, the Department of Veteran Affairs had the cemetery placed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

      "During the American Civil War, the southern states joined together against the Confederate States of America to fight against northern states, often referred to as the Union. The Florence Stockade was a prisoner-of-war camp where the Confederacy held Union soldiers from September 1864 to February 1865.",
      "In 1860, South Carolina was the first state to secede from the United States. It did so before the American Civil War even began, and the state eventually joined the Confederate States of America. In September 1864, Confederate Major Frederick F. Warley commanded enslaved Black people in the area to construct the Florence Stockade. The Confederacy chose this location because of the convergence of the North Eastern and Wilmington & Manchester Railroads.",
      "The South Carolina Reserves were among the Confederate guards here. These men were usually around the age of 17 or over 45. Temporarily during the stockade’s construction, the Union prisoners were held in a cornfield. There were many attempted escapes by the prisoners but most were recaptured with the help of dogs to hunt them down. There were some escapees who were successful, aided by enslaved men and women who helped them across Union lines.",
      "Most of their Union Prisoners were evacuated from the POW camp constructed in Andersonville, Georgia. They were evacuated in fear of Union forces liberating that camp. The POW camp housed as many as 16,000 Union prisoners, and 1,800 Confederate guards served at the camp. The Florence Stockade took up 23 ½ acres of land and the palisade was 1,400 by 725 feet. Deep moats were built to prevent prisoners from tunneling out, and the camp was surrounded by a 16-foot wall. Multiple cannons were placed at all four corners of the stockade to stop rioting among the prisoners. The Pye Branch Stream provided the camp water.",
      "Union prisoners built a makeshift hospital in the northwest corner. Most of the provided medicine was made from tree bark and roots. Twenty to 50 prisoners died each day of diseases (such as scurvy, measles, and typhoid fever), exposure, and starvation. In the fall of 1864, Union POW Private George Richard Crosby kept a journal while he was held at the Florence Stockade. He described his bad health and reported how some men switched sides. His journal also described the daily ration sizes.",
      "One example was a fourth pint of rice, five spoonfuls of molasses, and a walnut-sized potato. He also wrote about being a part of the exchange of ill soldiers between the Union and the Confederacy. In February 1865, he ended up in a Vermont military hospital.",
      "Union POWs worked as patrolmen, clerkmen, musicians, and hospital aides while living at the camp. The stockade also had a small sutler’s store where prisoners could barter for personal items. The prisoners built their own shelters, makeshift huts, and tree-bough-covered trenches that are still detectable. The prisoners were not the only ones who had to set up their own shelters.",
      "Confederate guards had to set up their own shelters, usually expensive and heavy Sibley tents that housed up to 12 men. Guards also provided their own gear. Some didn’t have adequate clothing. They were able to get meat in their rations, while POWs usually did not.",
      "In the spring of 1865, the guards shipped prisoners to North Carolina when Union Major General William Tecumseh Sherman entered South Carolina. Over 2,800 prisoners died and were buried on the Jarrott plantation in large trench graves. The POW’s death register information was lost after the war. In 1980, the stockade was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.",
      "The US Department of Veterans Affairs planned to expand the Florence National Cemetery to the south in 2005, so archaeologists began surveying the Stockade land. When surveying the land, they found artifacts such as buttons, canteens, glass, ceramic vessels, stone jugs, kitchenware, and ammunition. In 2008, the stockade was opened to the public with 15 marked walking trails and an interpretive gazebo. Weather permitting, you are welcome to park your car and walk the trails at this time."

      "Skilled craftsmen who were enslaved on the Gregg Plantation, mentioned within John Gregg’s 1839 will, built these cabins in approximately 1836. Some of these craftsmen were Eliza Davis, Simon, his wife Hannah, and Cooper Charlotte.",
      "Originally, there were eight cabins built together, and those on the plantation referred to them collectively as 'The Street.' We do not have much information on the first enslaved people who lived here due to a fire in the plantation home, Sunnyside, in 1926 that burned all the plantation and family records.",
      "Around roughly 1870, the cabins were expanded into second and third floors to house up to fourteen people. The fire burnt down the plantation’s 'big house,' leaving four cabins, two of which were on the Francis Marion University campus. Still, we know that Catherine and Tena were among the last people to have lived in the cabins around the 1950s, hence the cabins’ names.",
      "One of the reasons these cabins are still standing is due to a method called 'dovetailing.' Dovetailing ensures that water will run away from the house when it rains. The process is difficult to produce, proving the talent of those who built it. Another key feature of their craftsmanship is called hewing.",
      "Hewing is the process of stripping the wood to produce a flat surface, which leaves the inside of the log exposed; this exposure allows the sap produced inside of the log to serve as a natural barrier against nature, particularly bugs. Imagine having a home that is naturally protected from South Carolina mosquitoes.",
      "While these two cabins remain standing, this is not the ground they were built on. The residents moved them several times, and as Francis Marion grew, the cabins had to be moved to prevent further damage. In 1974, the National Register of Historic Places gave nine acres of land to be a permanent settlement for the cabins. Speaking of moving, both the South Carolina State Museum and the Washington Smithsonian wanted the cabins as historical artifacts but fate had other plans.",
      "In the case of the State Museum: the room they had built for the cabins was not large enough, so they had to leave them on campus grounds. And when the Smithsonian planned to take Mrs. Catherine’s cabin, Hurricane Hugo hit and dropped pine trees on the cabin, which damaged the second floor, returning the cabin to being one story so the Smithsonian no longer wanted it.",
      "Luckily, in 1993, the school’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), held a contest for students to create a sign that would explain the significance of the cabins in a way that did them justice. Angel Payton won the contest with a sign that reads:",
      "These cabins hold a history that has lasted for nearly 200 years, a history that serves as a reminder of how far African Americans and the Mars Bluff community have come. It is important to honor those who built the cabins and the longevity of their craftsmanship which sustained countless families over the years.",
      "The cabins and their residents have a lasting influence throughout the Florence community. Other stops in this tour include Mt. Zion United Methodist Church, Rosenwald School, and the Mt. Zion Cemetery, places the residents of the cabin frequented."

      "Scottish and Irish immigrants in Mars Bluff founded Hopewell Presbyterian Church in 1770. Some of the founders of Hopewell came from Indiantown Presbyterian Church in Williamsburg County and Aimwell Presbyterian Church in Marion County. Members of the Gregg family were among the first elders of Hopewell. The Greggs owned the plantation where the hewn-timber cabins on this tour once stood. In 1790, the church gained its full-time minister Reverend Humphrey Hunter, an Irish immigrant who had served as a lieutenant in the American Revolutionary War. Hopewell calls itself “The Mother Church of Presbyterianism in the Pee Dee,” as it led to the founding of Darlington Presbyterian and Effingham Presbyterian in the nineteenth century and Florence Presbyterian in the twentieth century.",
      "The original Hopewell Presbyterian Church building once stood where the cemetery is now. It burned down in the 1790s, and its replacement also later burned. The current building was completed in the 1840s. It is an example of Greek revival architecture. An education building was added in 1958, and another addition to the rear of the church was built in the 1980s.",
      "In the late 1700s and the first half of the 1800s, the congregation was made up primarily of area plantation owners. In 1852, church records indicated that there were 120 white members and 100 Black members. Since this was before the American Civil War, the Black members would have been enslaved. The church included an upper gallery for enslaved peoples to take part in segregated services. Washington Dozier, a formerly enslaved man interviewed during the Great Depression, recalled “De colored peoples worship to de white folks church in slavery time. You know dat Hopewell Church…dat a slavery church. Dat whe’ I go to church den wid my white folks.” After the Civil War broke out, most of the Black members left the church to found their own houses of worship. At least 40 of the men buried in the Hopewell Presbyterian Church Cemetery fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, including Robert Legare who later owned Red Doe Plantation, which is also on this tour. Many of their graves are marked with Confederate crosses in the grass.",
      "Although the cemetery has not been accurately mapped, church records from the 1890s suggest that the cemetery has been in use since the church’s founding. Trustees report the tradition of burying enslaved people in Hopewell cemetery, but there are no markers or depressions to support this. The Hopewell Cemetery Association formed in the 1940s to provide perpetual care of the cemetery. According to its bylaws, only those with ancestors buried here can also be interred here.",
      "The oldest memorial marker in the cemetery is that for Mary Elizabeth Gregg who died around 1815. She was the wife of James Gregg, a captain in the American Revolutionary War and a nearby plantation owner.",
      "In 1990, the Florence Heritage Foundation placed a historical marker for General William Wallace Harlee near the cemetery. Harlee was President of the Wilmington & Manchester Railroad and founder of the City of Florence. He named the city after his daughter. They are both buried in the cemetery. The church and cemetery were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000."

      "Members of the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church established the Mt. Zion Cemetery so they would be able to bury their loved ones; this cemetery is one of the earliest existing cemeteries for the African American community in the Mars Bluff area.",
      "The Mt. Zion Cemetery held huge significance for the community because prior to its purchase, members of the church were buried in unmarked graves. This cemetery section still exists in the far eastern corner of the acre and is known as the “Odd Fellows Graveyard,” in reference to The Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, an African American fraternal society, established in South Carolina during the late 1880s.",
      "The land for the cemetery was purchased on May 20, 1876, for one dollar from R.B. Fladger, who gave the land to the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church’s Board of Trustees.",
      "Sometime after the cemetery was in use, Amelia Wallace Vernon and Louise Sallenger gifted additional land. The headstones in the foremost section of the cemetery are from the original one-acre donation, and towards the back is the land given by Wallace and Sallenger.",
      "Some notable members of the community who were buried here, and still have headstones you can visit include Anthony Howard, Alex Gregg, Sherman Williamson, and Ernest Sellers.",
      "Anthony H. Howard was born in 1840 and passed away in 1908. Howard was a South Carolina State Legislature Black representative in 1874, during the Reconstruction era. Howard was also a board member of the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church and was known for being a prominent Black leader in the community. Howard’s headstone is a taller, thin, and rectangular shape, a stark contrast from the other headstones that are much wider. This headstone shows Howard’s important role in the community he provided for as well as his wealth and status overall.",
      "Alex Gregg, buried with his wife Emma Gregg, was born around 1845 and passed away in 1938. Gregg’s life inspired the book African-Americans at Mars Bluff, South Carolina, written by Amelia Wallace Vernon. The Gregg family members were enslaved on the Gregg plantation and lived in the Hewn-Timber Cabins that remain on the Francis Marion University campus.",
      "Sherman Willie Williamson was born in 1873 and passed away in 1950. Williamson wore many hats within the community; he was a carpenter, a butcher, a choir leader, and a trustee of the Mt. Zion Rosenwald School. Williamson married Mary Elizabeth Howard, the daughter of Anthony Howard, who passed away five years after Williamson.",
      "Ernest Jaybuck Sellers, Sr., was born in 1910 and passed away in 1989. Due to education for Black students ending at an elementary level, Sellers only received a 6th-grade education. As Sellers got older, he served in World War II and worked for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Henry Johnson, father of William Johnson, also worked for that railroad. You may learn more about them on this tour.",

      "The first site you will see at this location is Mt. Zion United Methodist Church. Plans for this Black Church began during the American Civil War in January 1863, just after the Emancipation Proclamation freed those enslaved in the South. Several local Black leaders, including Reconstruction South Carolina State Representative Anthony Howard, officially founded it in 1868, with Reverend James Wesley Johnson as its first minister. The church was originally called the Mt. Zion Methodist Episcopal Church.",

      "Before the church had a permanent structure, church services were held in a brush arbor. The shelter was constructed on vertical poles that had additional poles laying across the top of the shelter with branches and hay as the roof. However, the permanent structure was built in 1875. The church once had a steeple and a bell. Robert “Bob” Thomas was one of the first bell ringers for the church. The original church was warmed with a wood or coal-burning stove in the center.",

      "In 1970, the church was remodeled and covered in brick veneer. This remodeling included the addition of the John A. Sellers Fellowship Hall. The hall included a pastor’s study, a kitchen, and a Sunday School room. One of the trustees was Archie Waiters, who is buried in the Mt. Zion Cemetery and discussed on this tour. Members of the Waiters family have often served as trustees of the church and lived in the Hewn-Timber Cabins located on Francis Marion University’s campus.",

      "The church changed its name to Mt. Zion United Methodist Church in 1972 when the Black and white conferences merged to become the South Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church. The church’s next remodel took place in 1991, under Reverend John T. Hemingway’s administration. The church installed stained glass windows, new tiles for the fellowship hall, new carpet, and cushioned seats for the pews.",

      "Palma D. Thomas is the current reverend of the church, which is still an active place of worship today.",

      "Across the street from the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church resides the Mt. Zion Rosenwald School.",

      "Here, members of the then Mt. Zion Methodist Episcopal Church built the Mt. Zion School in 1870 as a school for Black children, since this was the first time that formerly enslaved people had legal access to education. Segregation meant they could not attend schools with white children in Mars Bluff, the region east of the city of Florence. The trustees of the church purchased one and three-quarter acres of land from Dr. Robert Benjamin Fladger for $35 to build a school for any child, regardless of color.",

      "The school featured grades first through sixth, and one or two teachers led combined classes during four to five-month periods, based around times that help would be needed for farming. Unfortunately, the original school burned down in the 1920s but Julius Rosenwald then funded it to be rebuilt.",

      "At the time, Rosenwald was the President of Sears, allowing him the funds to work towards rebuilding the school. Over 5 million dollars were spent on construction, school bus transportation, daycare programs, and donations for Black schools throughout the country. Florence’s Mount Zion School is one of the few Rosenwald schools still standing and not occupied for other purposes. Rosenwald was also responsible for the design of the buildings.",

      "The Rosenwald Fund granted the school roughly $2,000. Afterward, though, Black and white members of the community were encouraged to work together in pooling funds and building the school, including bake sales, fish fries, and other events so they would no longer need the support from the Rosenwald Fund.",

      "When the school was finished with construction, over 5 thousand students attended Rosenwald Schools. The Mt. Zion Rosenwald School in particular was the first public school created for African American students in the Mars Bluff community and remained in operation until 1952. While the school is not still in use today, it remains largely unchanged thanks to the preservation efforts of the Mt. Zion Methodist Church. There are even plans in the works to restore the school as a museum, ensuring such preservation efforts are maintained.",

      "The school has three rooms. The first one is located upon entering the building. This room served as the principal’s office and a small portion of it was also a classroom for fifth graders. They placed a curtain to divide the rooms.",

      "The second room also featured a separate outside door, but the stoop outside is gone now. On the wall between the 2nd and 3rd rooms was a blackboard used in room 2, but the wall was eventually removed to create a larger space that allowed for special events to take place for the community and school programs.",

      "The final room was at the northern end of the building, and it was approximately the same size as the second room. This room was used to teach first and second-grade students.",

      "Some records of students who attended the school are still in existence today. Annie Lee Robinson, who also lived in the Hewn-Timber Cabins now on Francis Marion University’s campus, was a student from 1947 until the school closed in 1952. Robinson started attending the Rosenwald school when she was roughly six years old. In an interview, she detailed how the students brought lunches from home and ate outside when the weather permitted. She also talked about how the students helped to gather firewood to help heat the school. The building typically ran on coal, but when it ran out, mainly the boys were sent to chop wood.",

      "Flora James was another student who attended the school from 1946 to 1951. In a recent interview, James recalled that she and Robinson walked over a mile to and from school each day. She also talked about how they received second-hand books from nearby white schools. She has been a long-time member of the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church and worked at Francis Marion University in her adulthood.",

      "The history of the Mt. Zion Church and the Rosenwald School is still recent enough that people today have memories of attending the school and upkeeping the church."

This was in reference to a Revolutionary War incident when Patriot scout Andrew Hunter escaped on a horse named “Red Doe” belonging to Loyalist Colonel David Fanning. In 1782, Colonel Fanning captured Hunter while he was scouting in North Carolina. Hunter managed to pull off a daring escape by stealing Fanning´s horse and taking his saddle, holsters, pistols, and papers. After the war, Hunter went on to work in the South Carolina House of Representatives and served on commissions for roads, navigation, and a new courthouse and jail.",

      "The house was restored between 1940 and 1941 by Marion Chisholm Wallace and his wife Annie Pearce Wallace. Marion was the great-grandnephew of Evander Gregg. After many years, the Red Doe Plantation continuously found itself in the hands of the Gregg family. The Wallaces renovated the property. It was featured in the Florence Homes and Gardens Tour in 1967, and the Wallaces received the Florence Harllee Silver Cup Award for its preservation efforts in 1979. In 1982, 9 acres of the plantation were added to the National Register of Historic Places.",

      "Then, in 2006, Robert Wilkins donated the land to a nonprofit organization, the Pee Dee Rifles, a local chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, for preservation. They hoped to make it into a museum, but the group was unable to raise enough funds. However, the group did host annual “living history” events at the plantation for several years. Funny enough, the Pee Dee Region Paranormal investigators even visited Red Doe in 2007.",

      "In 2009, Florence City and the County Historical Commission erected a historical marker on the site, which you are encouraged to read.",

Bruce and Lee Foundation, and focused on stabilizing the stairs and cypress columns. The Drs. Bruce and Lee Foundation also helped fund the museum and library that are featured on this tour.",

Wounded twice, he was a South Carolina Private in the 802 Pioneer Infantry. The Pioneer Infantry was similar to regular army troops in that they were trained in infantry tactics.",

      "However, the troops were also trained in combat engineering; twenty of the thirty-seven Pioneer Infantry Regiments were comprised of African-American soldiers. These men often built bridges and roads, which kept them within the lower ranks of the military. These segregated regiments represented the role that racial discrimination played in the U.S. during this time.",

      "Resting places like the Union Cemetery tell us a lot about the communities they serve. They are particularly important for learning about the histories of African American communities, as their histories were not well-documented during the era of segregation. This cemetery tells us about businesses, faith leaders, freemasons, and veterans as well as families. Many of the Black leaders of early Florence rest here, and many of their descendants continue to be buried in this cemetery."
